# pi-agent-browser

Native `pi` integration for [`agent-browser`](https://agent-browser.dev/).

## Status

Planning and design.

## Goal

Expose `agent-browser` to `pi` as a native tool so agents can automate the browser without going through a bash-backed skill.

## Product stance

- **Not bundled**: users install `agent-browser` separately and keep it on `PATH`
- **Latest-version only**: no backward-compatibility support or shims for older `agent-browser` versions
- **Thin wrapper**: stay close to upstream `agent-browser` instead of re-implementing its CLI
- **Agent-invoked first**: the main UX is the agent calling the tool directly, like `read` or `write`

Upstream install/docs:
- https://agent-browser.dev/
- https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser

## Why this exists

A native `pi` integration can improve on the current skill by adding:

- structured tool calls instead of shell strings
- parsed results instead of bash stdout
- inline screenshots and artifacts
- lightweight session convenience inside `pi`
- a better base for serious browser automation

## Example use cases

- UI testing and exploratory QA
- web research
- driving web UIs for ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, and Claude
- isolated authenticated browser sessions and cloned profiles

## Docs

- [`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`](docs/REQUIREMENTS.md) — product requirements and constraints
- [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — current architecture decision
- [`docs/TOOL_CONTRACT.md`](docs/TOOL_CONTRACT.md) — proposed v1 tool shape
- [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) — staged implementation plan

## Documentation rule

When requirements change in chat:

1. update `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`
2. update the affected design docs
3. update this README if user-facing expectations changed
