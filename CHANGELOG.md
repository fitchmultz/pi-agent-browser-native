# Changelog

## 0.1.1 - 2026-04-11

### Changed
- startup-scoped flags like `--profile`, `--session-name`, and `--cdp` now fail clearly when reused against an already-active implicit session instead of silently relying on upstream to ignore them
- prompt-based bash/help allowances are now derived from the current user prompt instead of mutable extension-global booleans, and the inspection allowance only triggers for tool-specific requests
- oversized subprocess stdout is now bounded in memory and spilled to private temp files before JSON parsing, reducing unbounded buffering risk without breaking large snapshot handling
- snapshot spill files now live under private temp directories with restrictive permissions and are cleaned up on shutdown
- failed upstream envelopes now synthesize clearer fallback error text when no simple top-level `error` string is present
- package/release verification now has a documented maintainer workflow, a tarball verifier script, a tracked repo-local `.pi` development shim, and a published tarball that excludes agent-only or superseded docs while including `LICENSE`
- npm publish prep now uses the available package name `pi-agent-browser-native`, adds author and gallery-friendly keywords, and updates README install guidance to show npm first and GitHub second

## 0.1.0 - 2026-04-09

### Added
- initial package scaffold for `pi-agent-browser`
- native `agent_browser` extension tool that wraps upstream `agent-browser --json`
- thin implicit-session support for the common path
- lightweight extension-level guards to keep direct bash `agent-browser` usage from becoming the primary path
- plain-text fallback for native `agent_browser --help` and `--version` inspection
- support for observed `batch --json` array output
- local TypeScript typecheck and unit-test setup
- concise product and implementation docs

### Changed
- removed the shipped skill override; extension hooks are the primary mechanism for preferring the native tool
- implicit `piab-*` sessions are now best-effort closed on `pi` shutdown and get an idle timeout so abandoned background daemons do not accumulate as easily
- tightened tool guidance so agents avoid falling back to osascript or other generic browser-driving bash commands when the native tool should be used
- taught the tool a clearer browser operating playbook so agents do not need to rediscover core `open` / `snapshot -i` / auth / tab-management patterns from `--help` on routine tasks
- refined the authenticated-content playbook to prefer `--profile Default` on the first browser call while reusing the extension-managed implicit session for normal personal feeds/dashboards; this avoids stale cross-run browser state from fixed explicit session names
- refined read-only browsing guidance so agents prefer extracting from the current snapshot, ref labels, or page-state eval before navigating away, and clarified that extraction evals should return values instead of relying on `console.log`
- generalized recovery guidance so unexpected `open` failures now point agents to inspect and recover tab/session state before retrying alternate URLs or fallback strategies
- improved native error presentation so upstream JSON error messages are shown to the agent instead of a generic `agent-browser exited with code 1.` when the CLI already reported a specific failure
- oversized `snapshot -i` results now switch to a browser-aware compact view for the model and spill the full raw snapshot JSON to a temp file referenced from tool details instead of always inlining the full snapshot tree
- refined compact snapshots to be main-content-first: prefer the primary content block and nearby sections over top-of-page chrome, ads, and unrelated sidebars when the snapshot structure makes that distinction possible
